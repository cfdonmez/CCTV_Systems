All about CCTV systems


### Hi everyone!

I've graduated in 2012 from TOBB ETU (www.etu.edu.tr)

I started participating CCTV projects since I was a student in my university.. I almost used anykind of camera in CCTV World.

This Section I'm planning to share my previous and current projects about CCTV and City Surveillance projects.. You can find cabling techniques,  mounting techniques, setting up Ghosts(I'll explain it later) 

To sum up, If you decided to design a scenario about CCTV, This section will help you I'm sure :)


Regards,
